Music player for children using an [M5Stack Core2](https://m5stack.com/collections/all/products/m5stack-core2-esp32-iot-development-kit), which is based on an ESP32 Microcontroller.

## Considerations

The player expects mp3 files in the folder /music on the SD card. Album art is displayed properly if it is embedded in the MP3 file as JPEG of size 400x400.
